You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

Your response goes here!

1. new skills:
  a). can fully use the [MDN element reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference)
  b). Web structure 'trees' and HTML syntax
  c). Can check my web syntax using Udacity Google Chrome Extensions

2. Easy stuff:
  a). HTML syntax
  b). understand web structure
  c). explore more syntax on MDN

3. Difficult stuff:
  * confuse about <figure></figure> tags, not sure when I have to use it instead using <p><img></p> tag.

4. Problem solving strategies:
  a). read instruction very carefully
  b). go through relevant html files very patiently (keep eyes on details)
  c). get my "hands dirty", tried to code everything which was required by course and compared with answers,
      if they were the same, I went through again; otherwise, think ago and re-do.
